Our platform eliminates all media breaks from the inspiration phase until the post-booking and travel phase. It can handle various ways of products. We’ve started with complex individual roundtrips in Asia (containing hotels, transfers, and all sorts of excursions), have built support for river and island cruises, and will grow into other package types such as self-drives and group tours with flexible extensions next. Our platform also significantly simplifies the whole distribution chain for these products. Companies using the Nezasa platform can have two roles in our business model: supplier and/or retailer. A retailer in our model is any company that sells packages to an end customer. It can be a travel agent, an OTA, a tour operator or DMC who does direct distribution, or even non-travel company who sells travel packages, e.g. an online magazine who sells trips related to the magazine topic. A supplier can be a DMC, a tour operator or even a more specialized provider of travel products. With our platform, retailers get new, flexible ways to source packages. They can decide from whom to source the packages (based on a global marketplace) and whether they want to be simple re-sellers or be responsible for the fulfillment. Our platform allows them to efficiently create itineraries based on pre-defined templates and influence them in various ways, either manually or automatically (based on customer profile, real-time market trends, etc). Retailers using the Nezasa platform get the industry’s most advanced omni-channel technology to sell these packages. Our planning tool can be used both online (in self-service mode) and offline (in a travel agency, agent with customer).

Our platform allows to show all available choices to the customer interactively. The packages planned on the Nezasa platform can be booked as a whole, the generation of travel documents is automated, and we can also automatically push the package info onto a mobile travel companion app. Suppliers get access to efficient global distribution.

We decided to rebuild the image workflow and the online visual experience entirely.  We solve all significant issues of displaying images online without slowing down websites, from the quality and size of photos to their formatting, compression, responsiveness, cropping, pixel density, color management, and security. The web platform we built on our iaas targets mainly photographers, but we also help enterprises, and agencies with their image need thanks to our APIs and plugins. In details:- You can upload your images in full quality and full size directly (up to 3 gigapixels), we take the maximum resolution and preserve it (jpeg, raw, psd, tiff).- You can easily embed your full-resolution photos to your website without slowing down your pages (like a Youtube video).- Zoom to the 100% size of your images without losing in quality.- Allow the download of you full-resolution images with custom settings and expiration dates.- Enable extra security for the pictures that matter the most. The security you wonder?  While it is impossible to guarantee 100% safety, Prodibi images are more secure than standard pictures by nature since only the parts and resolution needed are streamed to the viewers. The original image is never sent to the device of the viewer unless the download capacity is enabled. On top, right-click on the pictures is disabled, and all new albums are by default privates.To strengthen even more the security you can enable URL encryption, image encryption, watermarking, and stealth mode. The encryption and watermarking of photos can always be on or only when zoomed in at 100% to ensure the best compromise between quality, performance, and security. You can check our web service here; it is free: www.prodibi.com We also have a blog, a newsletter, and a Facebook group in which we share a weekly dose of stunning photos, please visit: mag.prodibi.com and www.facebook.com/groups/111916462828206 You can also find us on Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram @Prodibi",http://prodibi.com,https://www.top100startups.swiss/Prodibi

362,KB Medical SA ,Medtech,Robotics,Medtech,Neurology,Orthopedics,Surgery,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,October 2012,"KB Medical SA is a Swiss company focusing on the design, development and commercialization of the AQrate(TM) robotic system to empower surgeons with precise, cost-effective, robotic-assisted spinal and neuro surgery. The solution, initially designed for spinal surgery, has the strength required for orthopedic-surgery and the accuracy required for neuro-surgery. The Company’s mission is to provide a robotic system specifically designed for spinal and neuro surgery, and to integrate imaging, navigation, implants, instruments and robotics to work as a full solution to support minimally invasive surgery. The system integrates seamlessly into existing operating rooms and does not disrupt the workflow or standard procedure steps owing to its reliability and ease of use. The AQrate (Spine) solution is fully industrialized, expecting CE Mark by May 2016, and successfully validated by leading surgeons worldwide. The objective of the project, initially defined by a group of spinal surgeons, is to develop a system solution enabled by a haptic robot with intra-planning steering capabilities and requiring minimal change in the operating flow, which (i) provides the required accuracy and stability of the planned trajectory during percutaneous spinal surgery, and (ii) simplifies the procedure by integrating the benefits of imaging, navigation, dedicated implants and instruments to reduce time of surgery while increasing the overall safety for the patient and the surgical staff (less exposure to imaging radiation).The underlying technology includes haptic robot control, algorithms for no-go/stay-in zones, virtual ease or resistance in trajectories, motion tracking, active stability, re-registration of imaging and navigation based on detection of anatomy, and design of robot-enabled instrumentation and techniques to reduce the number of surgical steps. While these elements of the solution independently represent incremental yet significant innovation, the combination and the integration of imaging, navigation, instruments and implants enabled by the robot clearly enable a disruptive solution with the clear potential to enable large-scale adoption of minimally invasive spinal surgery. The AQrate(TM) includes both a robotic and a software platform. The robot is mounted on a cart and is wheeled at the operating table. Wheels are then retracted and the cart rests on rugged feet for maximum stability. The overall space taken at operating table is small, as specified in by the surgeons during the initial definition of their ideal solution.The robotic platform includes a medical-grade industrial robotic arm providing the required strength and accuracy at an affordable cost. A steering handle is attached to the tip of the robotic arm via a 6-axis force sensor to provide haptic steering and force-feed-back. Standard instruments can be attached to the steering handle and recognized automatically by weight and inertia.The software platform includes a host of steering and assistance algorithms, and can access information from both imaging and navigation devices.Once the robot is stabilized at the operating table, the surgeon adapts its instruments to the steering handle and grabs that handle as if he or she were holding the instrument itself. The robot will then follow the motion of the surgeon who positions the instruments to the right entry point and trajectory, checking the the navigation device. Once the instrument in place, the surgeon sets the robot in steady mode to actively maintain the trajectory while he or she performs whatever surgical step is required (drilling, tapping, screwing, …). All sorts of algorithms make the work easier, faster and safer.",http://kbmedical.com,https://www.top100startups.swiss/KB

Silp matches jobs with skills and interests by taking various criteria into account, such as the user’s professional information on Facebook (work, education, location, etc.), specified skills, interests, and job preferences. And since most people link to other sites from their Facebook profile, Silp can mine, parse, and extract skills and interests from other online profiles as well (like Twitter, Blog, Tumblr, LinkedIn, About.me, GitHub, Stackoverflow, Behance, Zerply, Dribbble, etc.). The matching improves over time as Silp learns from feedback mechanisms, such as a user’s reactions to suggested job offers. Silp also matches jobs with the social graph. It provides employers with the tools to identify potential candidates in their and their company’s network. When an employer posts a job vacancy, they, their co-workers and friends can see who in their extended network (friends and friends-of-friends) might be a good fit for the position. They can then recommend the job further or seek guidance, thus letting the job travel the social graph until the right candidates are found. Most people find jobs through their network of friend – Silp automates and supercharges this process. When a job match is found, users will be informed by email or by a Facebook message from a friend.

471,Doodle AG ,ICT,Software,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,November 2006,"Some questions are more informative than their answers. This was the kind of question posed to Paul Sevinç, co-founder of Doodle, during a recent event at the Technopark Lucerne. An audience member wanted to know how Doodle deals with the enormous responsibility of having thousands of Swiss so dependent on the reliable operation of this event scheduler. Doodle has fundamentally changed how events are scheduled in Switzerland. The tool has a million users each month in this country alone, but they make up just a small fraction of all the Doodlers out there. Each month, a total of more than nine million people coordinate their business and leisure events with Doodle. “We’re by far the most popular supplier of this service anywhere in the world,” says co-founder and CEO Michael Näf. The basis for this rapid increase in user numbers is the tool’s built-in growth mechanism. Once someone sets up an event poll, all the participants see the advantages of Doodle. Some of them will then use the platform themselves, which in the next step increases the circle of users even more. People who try Doodle once stick with it thanks in large part to its user-friendly operation ¬¬– which is due to more than just its lack of unnecessary technical bells and whistles. The reworking of the mobile version this year clearly showed the Doodle team’s thorough approach to product development. Before releasing the new version, the company surveyed 1,400 users around the world to find out how they use their mobile phones when accessing the Internet.",http://www.doodle.ch,https://www.top100startups.swiss/Doodle
